# Statium Webapp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/statium-app/statium-webapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/statium-app/statium-webapp)

Statium Webapp is a web calendar for the football/soccer fans.

This is a hobby attempt to give another go to what once was a startup full-time project. ðŸ¤ž
The budget is not the same as it used to so this time, we're going the open source way
to get as much contributors as possible.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `make install`

Downloads all external dependencies required to run the project.

### `make run`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `make test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `make build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
The app is ready to be deployed!

### `make clean`

Removes all files that are ignored by Git (ie `build` and `node_modules`) so
that you can get back to _clean_ development state if needed.
